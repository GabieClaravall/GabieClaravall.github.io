		<p> One of my favorite projects that I have accomplished at Girls Who Code was the city scroller project.  The purpose of this assignment was to create a 2d video game where the background would constantly move in a single direction across the screen.  In city scroller, I created buildings of different sizes and placed them in the front, middle, and back scroller.

Write a program that simulates this behavior called City Scroller. Your teacher has a template for you to use that breaks down the problem further. Your teacher has a copy of what it should look like in the end. Get as creative as you want, but do the bare minimum as shown by your teacher first.
